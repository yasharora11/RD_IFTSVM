This repository contains the implementation of the model discussed in the article entitled "A Novel Relative Density and Nonmembership-Based Intuitionistic Fuzzy Twin SVM for Class Imbalance Learning". The script Run_experiment.py demonstrates the code using the "WPBC" dataset and evaluates its performance via 10-fold cross-validation.
